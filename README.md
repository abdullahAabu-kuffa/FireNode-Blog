# FireNode Blog

## Overview
**FireNode Blog** is a full-stack application built with Node.js that provides a blogging platform with advanced features including:
- **JWT-based user authentication** and **bcrypt password hashing**.
- **Role-based access control** (user and admin roles).
- **Email verification** for users.
- **CRUD operations** for posts and comments.
- **Image uploads** using Firebase Storage for both posts and user profiles.
- **Search and filtering** capabilities for posts (bonus feature).

This project is designed to allow users to post content, interact with others through comments, and manage their profiles, while admins have full control over all content and users.

## Features
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure login system with JSON Web Tokens for user validation.

  - Admins can create, update, delete any post, comment, and manage users.
- **Email Verification**: Ensures users verify their email before accessing certain features.
- **Firebase Integration**:
  - Firebase Firestore for database storage (users, posts, comments).
  - Firebase Storage for handling images (post images and profile pictures).
- **Profile Management**: Users can manage their profile, including uploading a profile picture.
- **Search & Filtering**: Users can search posts by title, author, and filter posts by category.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend server and API logic.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for routing.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Authentication and authorization for secure API access.
